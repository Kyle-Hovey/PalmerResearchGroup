<div id="bodytitle">Welcome to the Palmer Project</div>

<p>
	Palmer amaranth is a super-weed currently located in over half of Iowa counties and has been recently added to the Iowa noxious weed list. Palmer amaranth can grow two to three inches a day, reach a height of seven feet, and produce up to a million seeds per plant. This dangerous weed can also carry resistance to multiple herbicides and has devastated southern agriculture since the 1990’s. Even a moderately infested field can lead to 2/3 yield losses for corn and soybeans.

	The Palmer Project began in 2015 as part of the Bryan Summer Research Program in Mathematics at Simpson College. This project started with the goal of creating a mathematical model to simulate the spread of super-weed Palmer amaranth across Iowa, but the scope of the project expanded due to the complexity of this problem. Now, with sponsorship from ADM and BASF, the Palmer Project is modeling the spread of Palmer amaranth across Iowa, collecting qualitative interviews from farmers, and working on an awareness campaign to create better weed management in the age of herbicide resistance.

What makes the Palmer Project different from most agricultural research groups is its interdisciplinary approach. The team, led by Dr. Clint Meyer and Dr. John Pauley, professors of environmental science and philosophy respectively, brings together students with nine different majors, from neuroscience to political science. The team blends both quantitative and qualitative methods together to better understand the story of herbicide use and resistance in the U.S. Corn Belt. The one-of-a-kind mathematical model visually depicts the possibilities facing Midwestern agriculture and opens the door for insightful conversations with local stakeholders. These conversations help the team adapt the model to be more accurate and expose further areas that influence the problem. The quantitative and qualitative methods continuously inform the other and work together to maximize the research’s impact.
