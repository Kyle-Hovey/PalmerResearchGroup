			<h1>Welcome to the Palmer Project.</h1>
			<h2>The Palmer Project at Simpson College has recently developed a model for assessing risk of Palmer amaranth infestation in the state of Iowa. The purpose of this website is to allow producers, and any other interested stakeholder, to see Palmer amaranth infestation risk in any location within Iowa. The model is based in predictive analytics and was produced from the analysis of multiple data sets.</h2>
