				<h1>Iowa Palmer Risk Assessment</h1>
				<h2>
					We created the webtool to share the information gathered from our 2017 geodemographic model. It will provide a percentile value indicating the risk value associated with the chosen location. For example a risk value of <strong>90&#37;</strong> means that the location that you have clicked is in the <strong>top 10%</strong> of riskiest locations in Iowa. More detail about what this value represents can be found below the webtool.
				</h2>
				<h2>
					To use the webtool, search for your location or pan by clicking and dragging on the map. Once you have found your location click on the map to get your risk.

			<h1>About this tool</h1>
			<h2>This tool provides access to the model that our research team has created. The model calculates a risk value for nearly every location in the state of Iowa. Values are calculated relative to other locations that are known to have palmer infestations. Our model also takes into account factors outside of a farmer's control such as average highest temperature, soil quality, elevation, rainfall and wind. We have also included demographic information, some of which is under the control of individual farmers, to compute a risk value. The final risk value represents how similar or dissimilar the location is to places known to be infested with palmer.</h2>
